## Setup

The best way to get started with Glee is using `create-glee-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-glee-app
```

After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server.

For more information on how to use `create-glee-app`, you can review [the `create-glee-app` documentation](https://github.com/asyncapi/create-glee-app).

## Examples

Have a look at the [examples](./examples) folder of this repository to get a better grasp on how to use it.
